## Introduction

Fire is one of humanity’s most important discoveries, but if misused or left uncontrolled, it can lead to catastrophic damage to life, property, and nature. Traditional fire detection methods often fall short, especially in cases like wildfires. With advancements in technology and machine learning, it's now possible to detect fire early using deep learning models. In this project, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using transfer learning with VGG16 to classify images as **Fire** or **No Fire**, achieving up to **97% accuracy** on unseen data.
